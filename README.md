## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that with position absolute I can achive curved patterns. But its wobbly means that when I adjust the screen it protects its width and ratio and collapses on each other.

Edit: I found that its cause  is that images were hard coded. When I switch width to auto and height to 100% they stopped going on top of each other.


### Continued development

I may need more practice on positioning.
